        <h1>Payment Method</h1>
        <p>Cash on Delivery (COD) is a popular payment method where the customer pays for the goods at the time of delivery. This method is particularly useful for customers who do not have access to online payment options or prefer to inspect the product before making a payment. COD provides a sense of security and trust for the buyer, as they only part with their money once they have received and verified the product.</p>
